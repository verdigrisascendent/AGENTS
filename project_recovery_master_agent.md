Yes, this **is** a Markdown-based agent specification and documentation file. It should be placed under your `Agents/` directory as `project_recovery_master_agent.md` for consistency with your other agent definitions.

- **Purpose:** It describes the PRMAâ€™s role, folder layout, YAML spec, and GDScript implementation details.
- **Integration:** The YAML header defines how this agent is run, its entrypoints, sources of truth, outputs, and contracts.
- **Execution:** The GDScript inside is the actual runnable code (`prma.gd`) that you drop into the `res://tools/recovery/` directory.

**Recommendation:**
1. Save this doc as `Agents/project_recovery_master_agent.md`.
2. Ensure the GDScript files and folder structure described are added to your Godot project.
3. Run the PRMA as outlined to diagnose, auto-repair, and verify your project.

Would you like me to **refactor it into two files**: one `.md` agent spec and one minimal `README.md` for quick instructions, while leaving the `.gd` files separate?
